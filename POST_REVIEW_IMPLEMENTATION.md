## Form Validation

The form validates that all fields are filled:

- Purchase date must be selected
- Car make/model must be selected
- Car year must be entered

If any field is missing, an alert will display: "All details are mandatory"

## API Endpoints Used

1. **Get Dealer Details**: `GET /djangoapp/dealer_details/{id}`
2. **Get Car Models**: `GET /djangoapp/get_cars`
3. **Submit Review**: `POST /djangoapp/add_review`

## Review Data Structure

When submitted, the review includes:
```json
{
  "name": "User's Full Name or Username",
  "dealership": "dealer_id",
  "review": "Review text",
  "purchase": true,
  "purchase_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "car_make": "Make",
  "car_model": "Model",
  "car_year": "Year"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### CarMake Dropdown Not Working
If the car make dropdown is empty or not working:
1. Ensure the Django server is running
2. Check that car models are initialized in the database
3. Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/djangoapp/get_cars to verify data is available
4. If empty, you may need to run the database initialization

### Review Not Appearing After Submission
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the sentiment analysis service is running (optional - defaults to neutral if unavailable)
3. Refresh the dealer details page manually

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure you're logged in before accessing the post review page
- Check sessionStorage for username: Open browser console and type `sessionStorage.getItem("username")`
- If not logged in, the review submission may fail

## Next Steps

After completing this task:
1. Test with multiple dealers
2. Test with different car makes and models
3. Verify sentiment analysis is working correctly
4. Ensure reviews persist across page refreshes
