# TODO List for Adding and Setting Up REACT Component for Dealers Page

- [x] Edit server/djangoapp/urls.py to append "/" to the get_dealers path (change 'get_dealers' to 'get_dealers/').
- [x] Build the frontend: Navigate to server/frontend, run npm install, then npm run build.
- [ ] Start the MongoDB server (ensure it's installed and running on macOS). Note: MongoDB not found; may need installation or different command.
- [x] Start the Django development server on port 8000 (python manage.py runserver 8000).
- [ ] Launch browser at http://localhost:8000/dealers, verify dealers list is displayed, and take screenshot saving as get_dealers.png. Note: Browser tool disabled; cannot automate screenshots.
- [ ] Log in with valid credentials via the login panel, navigate to dealers page, verify dealer details and review option, take screenshot saving as get_dealers_loggedin.png. Note: Browser tool disabled; cannot automate screenshots.
- [ ] Select a state from the dropdown (e.g., any available state), verify filtered dealers, take screenshot saving as dealersbystate.png. Note: Browser tool disabled; cannot automate screenshots.
